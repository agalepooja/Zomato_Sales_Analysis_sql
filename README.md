Zomato_Sales_Analysis_sql

This project includes 16 real-world business questions solved using a Zomato-style food delivery database.
As a fresher data analyst, I built this project to practice advanced SQL concepts and analyze real-life food delivery operations involving customers, restaurants, delivery partners, orders, and payments.

I used this dataset to practice advanced SQL concepts such as:

1.select

2.Joins

3.Aggregate functions

4.Subqueries

5.Window functions (RANK, OVER, PARTITION BY)

6.CTEs (WITH clause
